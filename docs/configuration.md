# Configuration

The packages of the JSON RPC Relay support loading of configuration from an `.env` file or via the
environment.

## Default Values

The default configuration allows users to quickly get up and running without having to configure anything. This provides
ease of use at the trade-off of some insecure default configuration. Most configuration settings have appropriate
defaults and can be left unchanged. It is recommended to browse the properties below and adjust to your needs.

A few properties omit a default value as they relate to account information and Hedera environment details.
These properties are noted below and should be custom set per deployment.

- `CHAIN_ID`
- `HEDERA_NETWORK`
- `MIRROR_NODE_URL`
- `OPERATOR_ID_MAIN`
- `OPERATOR_KEY_MAIN`
- `SERVER_PORT`

**Note**: The default logging level in the TypeScript application is set to trace.

## Relay

The following table lists the available properties along with their default values for the [Relay package](/packages/relay/).
Unless you need to set a non-default value, it is recommended to only populate overridden properties in the custom `.env`.

- **_NOTE:_** Replace the redacted operator ID and keys with your own.
- **_NOTE 2:_** Default values for all other keys are sufficient, no need to set them.
- **_NOTE 3:_** The above files have been provided for your convenience within the examples directory of this repo. For example, for the Hedera Testnet configuration, run this command in the root directory of this project: `cp ./docs/examples/.env.testnet.sample ./.env`

## Testing

The following table lists the available properties along with their default values for the tests utilized in the [Server](/packages/server/) and [Relay](/packages/relay/) packages.
Unless you need to set a non-default value, it is recommended to only populate overridden properties in the custom `.env`.

> **_NOTE:_** Acceptance tests can be pointed at a remote locations (previewnet and testnet and custom environments). In this case configuration will require details for remote consensus node gRPC endpoints [previewnet / testnet](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/networks/testnet/testnet-nodes) / [mainnet](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/networks/mainnet/mainnet-nodes) and [Mirror Node REST API endpoints](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/rest-api), be sure to configure `HEDERA_NETWORK` and `MIRROR_NODE_URL` appropriately to point away from your local host and to valid deployed services. When pointing to previewnet and testnet, account Ids (`OPERATOR_ID_MAIN`) and private keys (`OPERATOR_KEY_MAIN`) for previewnet and tests may be obtained from the [Hedera Portal](http://portal.hedera.com).

> **_NOTE 3:_**: Unlike ethereum, Hedera does not allow clients to set their own gas price in order to prioritize their transaction. The price is "published in a fee schedule file, so all Hedera clients pay the same gas price", which helps give Hedera clients predictability in gas costs. Hedera transaction fees are set in fiat(USD) but paid using the gas price in HBAR. The value of HBAR fluctuates with the market so the gas price fluctuates as well. The TEST_GAS_PRICE_DEVIATION allows for a range of gas prices reflecting the current market rates, when testing the current gas price in the acceptance tests.
