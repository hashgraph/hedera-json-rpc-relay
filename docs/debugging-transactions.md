## Overview

[Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) provides powerful debugging tools that allow developers to inspect and analyze
the execution of smart contracts.

This guide will walk you through the various debugging capabilities available, including:

1. how to use the built-in debugger in Remix to step through the execution of a transaction and inspect the state of
   your smart contracts, and
2. how to manually call the `debug_traceTransaction` method and analyze the response to get detailed information about
   the execution of a transaction.

## 1. Debugging with Remix

The built-in debugger in Remix allows you to step through the execution of a transaction, inspect the state, and
understand the behavior of your smart contracts.

### Steps to Use the Built-in Debugger

Official Documentation: [Remix Debugger](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugger.html)

1. **Set Up Remix with a Local Node**:
    - Ensure you have a local node running that supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method.
      <!-- refer to an actual local node version here after releasing the `debug_traceTransaction` fix from #2777 -->
    - Set up MetaMask to point to the URL of your local node (`http://localhost:7546`) and connect to an account.
    - Connect Remix to MetaMask by selecting "Injected Provider - MetaMask" in the
      ["Deploy & Run"](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#environment) tab.

2. **Deploy or Load Contract**:
    - [Create and deploy your smart contract](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create_deploy.html)
      using the Remix IDE or load an existing contract on the local node by providing its address.

3. **Run a Transaction**:
    - [Interact with your deployed contract](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/udapp.html#deploy-run-part-2)
      by sending a transaction (e.g., calling a function).

4. **Access the Debugger**:
    - Remix displays information related to each transaction in the terminal. (e.g., transaction hash, status, etc.)
    - MetaMask blocks access to the `debug_traceTransaction` method, so you need to change the environment to
      "External Http Provider" pointing to your local node.
    - Open the "Debugger" tab, enter the transaction hash and click on "Start debugging".

5. **Use the Debugger**:
    - The Remix Debugger will open, allowing you to step through the transaction execution.
    - You can inspect the state, stack, memory, any errors and other details at each step of the execution.

### Example of Debugging a Transaction in Remix

Here’s a simple example of how to deploy and interact with a contract in Remix:

#### Solidity Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

#### Steps in Remix

1. **Select an Environment**:
    - Open Remix and go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
    - Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask" to connect to your local node.

2. **Deploy the Contract**:
    - Compile the `SimpleStorage` contract through the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
    - Deploy it by selecting it in the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and clicking "Deploy".
    - MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.

3. **Interact with the Contract**:
    - Call the `set` function with a value (e.g., `42`) through the "Deployed Contracts" section.
    - MetaMask will prompt you again to confirm the transaction.

4. **Change the Environment**:
    - Switch the environment to "External Http Provider" and enter the URL of your local node (`http://localhost:7546`).

5. **Debug the Transaction**:
    - Go to the terminal in Remix and click on the transaction to see its details and copy the transaction hash.
    - Open the "Debugger" tab, paste the transaction hash, and click "Start debugging".
    - Use the debugger to step through the transaction and inspect the state changes.

## 2. Debugging with Truffle

[Truffle](https://archive.trufflesuite.com) is a popular development framework for Ethereum smart contracts that
provides
built-in debugging capabilities.

### Steps to Use the Debugger in Truffle

Official Documentation:
[Truffle Debugger](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/debug-test/use-the-truffle-debugger/)

1. **Install Truffle**:
    - Install Truffle using npm: `npm install -g truffle`.
2. **Initialize a new Truffle project**:
    - Initialize using `truffle init`.
3. **Set Up Your Environment**:
    - Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider`
    - Configure your development environment in the `truffle-config.js` file.
    - Ensure you have a local node running that supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method.

- Connect to the local node by specifying the network configuration. (e.g., `http://localhost:7546`)
  ```javascript
  const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
  module.exports = {
    networks: {
      development: {
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        port: 7546,
        network_id: '*',
        provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(
          [
            '0x105d050185ccb907fba04dd92d8de9e32c18305e097ab41dadda21489a211524', // operator private key
            '0x2e1d968b041d84dd120a5860cee60cd83f9374ef527ca86996317ada3d0d03e7' // receiver private key
          ],
          'http://localhost:7546'
        )
      },
    },
  };
  ```

1. **Write and Compile Your Contracts**:
    - Add your `SimpleStorage` contract in the `contracts/` directory.
    - Compile your contracts: `truffle compile`.
2. **Deploy and Interact with Your Contracts**:
    - Deploy your contracts to the local network: `truffle migrate`.
    - Interact with your contracts using Truffle console or scripts.
    - Call functions and send transactions to test your contracts.
3. **Debug Your Contracts**:
    - Use the Truffle debugger to step through the execution of your contracts.
    - Run the debugger using `truffle debug <transaction_hash>`.
4. **Analyze the Execution Flow**:
    - Analyze the execution flow and identify any issues in your smart contracts.
    - Truffle Debugger Commands:
      ```
      Commands:
      (enter) last command entered (step next)
      (o) step over, (i) step line / step into, (u) step out, (n) step next
      (c) continue until breakpoint, (Y) reset & continue to previous error
      (y) (if at end) reset & continue to final error
      (;) step instruction (include number to step multiple)
      (g) turn on generated sources, (G) turn off generated sources except via `;`
      (p) print instruction & state (`p [mem|cal|sto]*`; see docs for more)

    - Re-run the debugger to verify the changes and ensure the correct behavior.
    - Continue testing and debugging until you are satisfied with the results.

### Example of Debugging a Transaction in Truffle

Here’s a simple example of how to deploy and interact with a contract in Truffle:

#### Solidity Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

#### Steps in Truffle

1. Modify the `migrations/1_deploy_contracts.js` script to deploy and interact with the `SimpleStorage` contract:
   ```javascript
   const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require("SimpleStorage");
   
   module.exports = async function (deployer) {
      await deployer.deploy(SimpleStorage);
      const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deployed();
      console.log("Contract Address:", simpleStorage.address);
      const result = await simpleStorage.set(42);
      console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.tx);
      const storedData = await simpleStorage.get();
      console.log("Stored Data:", storedData.toNumber());
   };
   ```
2. Run the Truffle script to deploy and interact with the contract:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```
3. Debug the transaction using the Truffle debugger:
   ```bash
   truffle debug <place_tx_hash_here>
   ```
4. Use the debugger commands to step through the transaction and inspect the state changes.
5. Example output after running the debugger:
   ```bash
   SimpleStorage.sol:
   
   3: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   4:
   5: contract SimpleStorage {
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
   debug(development:0xe122240e...)> # Clicking enter here will step to the next line
   ```
6. Output after clicking enter several times to step through the transaction:
   ```bash
   SimpleStorage.sol:
   
   6:     uint256 public storedData;
   7:
   8:     function set(uint256 x) public {
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
   debug(development:0xe122240e...)>
   
   Transaction completed successfully.
   ```
7. Done! You have successfully debugged a transaction using the Truffle debugger.

## 3. Advanced Debugging with `debug_traceTransaction`

For more advanced debugging, you can directly use the `debug_traceTransaction` method.
This method allows you to trace the execution of a transaction, providing detailed information about each call made
during the transaction.

### Manually Calling `debug_traceTransaction`

1. **Set Up a Local Node**:
    - Ensure you have a local node running that supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method.
    - Connect to your local node using
      a [web3 provider](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3.html#currentprovider).

2. **Send a JSON-RPC Request**:
    - You can use the `web3.currentProvider.send` method to call `debug_traceTransaction` with `callTracer` or
      `opcodeLogger` as the tracer type.

3. **View the Results**:
    - The results of the `debug_traceTransaction` call will be logged in the console.
    - You can inspect the detailed trace of the transaction, including all internal calls and their respective details.
    - Analyze the trace to understand the flow of execution and identify any issues in your smart contract.

### Examples of Using `debug_traceTransaction`

#### 1. With `callTracer`:

The `callTracer` tracer type provides detailed information about each call made during the transaction. You can inspect
the call frame objects to understand the flow of execution and identify any issues.

##### Example Code:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:7546'); // Connect to your local node

// Function to trace a transaction using debug_traceTransaction
async function traceTransaction(txHash) {
  return web3.currentProvider.send({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'debug_traceTransaction',
    params: [
      txHash,
      {
        tracer: 'callTracer',
        tracerConfig: { onlyTopCall: false }
      }
    ]
  });
}

// Example usage
const txHash = '0x8fc90a6c3ee3001cdcbbb685b4fbe67b1fa2bec575b15b0395fea5540d0901ae';
traceTransaction(txHash).then(result => console.log(result));
```

##### Response Schema:

##### CallFrame

The `CallFrame` object represents a call made during the transaction execution. It contains detailed information about
the call, including the `from` and `to` addresses, the amount of value transferred, gas provided, gas used, input data,
output data, error, revert reason, and any sub-calls made during the call.

It contains the following fields:

- `type`: **string** - `"CALL"` or `"CREATE"`
- `from`: **string** - hex-encoded address
- `to`: **string** - hex-encoded address
- `value`: **string** - hex-encoded amount of value transfer
- `gas`: **string** - hex-encoded gas provided for call
- `gasUsed`: **string** - hex-encoded gas used during call
- `input`: **string** - call data
- `output`: **string** - return data
- `error`: **string** - error, if any
- `revertReason`: **string** - solidity revert reason, if any
- `calls`: **CallFrame[]** - nested list of sub-calls containing the same fields

##### Example Response:

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. With `opcodeLogger`:

The `opcodeLogger` tracer type provides detailed information about each opcode executed during the transaction. You can
inspect the `StructLog` objects to understand the flow of execution in the EVM and identify any issues.

##### Example Code:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:7546'); // Connect to your local node

// Function to trace a transaction using debug_traceTransaction with opcodeLogger
async function traceTransaction(txHash) {
  return web3.currentProvider.send({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'debug_traceTransaction',
    params: [
      txHash,
      {
        tracer: 'opcodeLogger',
        tracerConfig: { enableMemory: true, disableStack: false, disableStorage: false }
      }
    ]
  });
}

// Example usage
const txHash = '0x8fc90a6c3ee3001cdcbbb685b4fbe67b1fa2bec575b15b0395fea5540d0901ae';
traceTransaction(txHash).then(result => console.log(result));
```

##### Response Schema:

##### OpcodeTrace

The `OpcodeTrace` object represents the trace of a transaction execution in the EVM.

It contains the following fields:

- `gas`: **number** - total gas used during the execution.
- `failed`: **boolean** - indicates whether the transaction failed.
- `returnValue`: **string | null** - hex-encoded return value of the transaction.
- `structLogs`: **StructLog[]** - list of `StructLog` objects representing the opcodes executed during the transaction.

##### StructLog

The `StructLog` object represents an individual opcode executed during a smart contract transaction.

**NOTE:** The state displayed for each `StructLog` refers to the state after executing said opcode.

It contains the following fields:

- `pc`: **number** - program counter.
- `op`: **string** - opcode.
- `gas`: **number** - gas remaining.
- `gasCost`: **number** - gas cost of the opcode.
