## Overview

[Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) provides powerful debugging tools that allow developers to inspect and analyze the execution of smart contracts.

This guide will walk you through the various debugging capabilities available in Remix, including:

1. how to use the built-in debugger in Remix to step through the execution of a transaction and inspect the state of your smart contracts, and
2. how to manually call the `debug_traceTransaction` method and analyze the response to get detailed information about the execution of a transaction.

## 1. Built-in Remix Debugger

The built-in debugger in Remix allows you to step through the execution of a transaction, inspect the state, and understand the behavior of your smart contracts.

### Steps to Use the Built-in Debugger

Official Documentation: [Remix Debugger](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugger.html)

1. **Set Up Remix with a Local Node**:
   - Ensure you have a local node running that supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method.
   - Connect Remix to your local node by selecting the "Web3 Provider" option in the Remix IDE and entering the URL of your local node (e.g., `http://localhost:8545`).

2. **Deploy or Load Contract**:
   - [Create and deploy your smart contract](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create_deploy.html) using Remix or load an existing contract by providing its address.

3. **Run a Transaction**:
   - Interact with your deployed contract by sending a transaction (e.g., calling a function).

4. **Access the Debugger**:
   - Remix displays information related to each transaction result in the terminal.
   - After the transaction has been processed, check in the terminal to see where it is logged.
   - Find the transaction you just executed and click on the debug icon next to it.

5. **Use the Debugger**:
   - The Remix Debugger will open, allowing you to step through the transaction execution.
   - You can inspect the state, stack, memory, any errors and other details at each step of the execution.

### Example of Debugging a Transaction

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to deploy and interact with a contract in Remix:

#### Solidity Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

#### Steps in Remix

1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Compile the `SimpleStorage` contract.
   - Deploy it using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

2. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Call the `set` function with a value (e.g., `set(42)`).

3. **Debug the Transaction**:
   - Go to the terminal in Remix to see the transaction details.
   - Find the `set` transaction and click the debug icon.
   - Use the debugger to step through the transaction and inspect the state changes.

## 2. Advanced Debugging with `debug_traceTransaction`

For more advanced debugging, you can directly use the `debug_traceTransaction` method. This method allows you to trace the execution of a transaction, providing detailed information about each call made during the transaction.

### Manually Calling `debug_traceTransaction`

1. **Set Up Remix with a Local Node**:
   - Ensure you have a local node running that supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method.
   - Connect Remix to your local node by selecting the "Web3 Provider" option in the Remix IDE and entering the URL of your local node (e.g., `http://localhost:8545`).

2. **Send a JSON-RPC Request**:
   - Use the Remix console to send a JSON-RPC request to the local node.
   - You can use the `web3.currentProvider.send` method to call `debug_traceTransaction` with `callTracer` or `opcodeLogger` as the tracer type.

3. **View the Results**:
   - The results of the `debug_traceTransaction` call will be logged in the Remix console.
   - You can inspect the detailed trace of the transaction, including all internal calls and their respective details.
   - Analyze the trace to understand the flow of execution and identify any issues in your smart contract.

### Examples of Using `debug_traceTransaction`

#### 1. With `callTracer`:

The `callTracer` tracer type provides detailed information about each call made during the transaction. You can inspect the call frame objects to understand the flow of execution and identify any issues.

##### Example Code:

```javascript
// Connect to the local node using Remix's web3 provider
const web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);

// Function to trace a transaction using debug_traceTransaction
async function traceTransaction(txHash) {
   return web3.currentProvider.send({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id: 1,
      method: 'debug_traceTransaction',
      params: [txHash, { tracer: 'callTracer' }, { onlyTopCall: false }]
   });
}

// Example usage
const txHash = '0x8fc90a6c3ee3001cdcbbb685b4fbe67b1fa2bec575b15b0395fea5540d0901ae';
const result = await traceTransaction(txHash);
console.log(result);
```

##### Response Schema:

##### CallFrame

The `CallFrame` object represents a call made during the transaction execution. It contains detailed information about the call, including the `from` and `to` addresses, the amount of value transferred, gas provided, gas used, input data, output data, error, revert reason, and any sub-calls made during the call.

It contains the following fields:

- `type`: **string** - `"CALL"` or `"CREATE"`
- `from`: **string** - hex-encoded address
- `to`: **string** - hex-encoded address
- `value`: **string** - hex-encoded amount of value transfer
- `gas`: **string** - hex-encoded gas provided for call
- `gasUsed`: **string** - hex-encoded gas used during call
- `input`: **string** - call data
- `output`: **string** - return data
- `error`: **string** - error, if any
- `revertReason`: **string** - solidity revert reason, if any
- `calls`: **CallFrame[]** - nested list of sub-calls containing the same fields

                     }
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

#### 2. With `opcodeLogger`:

The `opcodeLogger` tracer type provides detailed information about each opcode executed during the transaction. You can inspect the `StructLog` objects to understand the flow of execution in the EVM and identify any issues.

##### Example Code:

```javascript
// Connect to the local node using Remix's web3 provider
const web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);

// Function to trace a transaction using debug_traceTransaction with opcodeLogger
async function traceTransaction(txHash) {
   return web3.currentProvider.send({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id: 1,
      method: 'debug_traceTransaction',
      params: [txHash, { tracer: 'opcodeLogger', disableMemory: false, disableStack: false, disableStorage: false }]
   });
}

// Example usage
const txHash = '0x8fc90a6c3ee3001cdcbbb685b4fbe67b1fa2bec575b15b0395fea5540d0901ae';
const result = await traceTransaction(txHash);
console.log(result);
```

##### Response Schema:

- `returnValue`: **string | null** - hex-encoded return value of the transaction.
- `structLogs`: **StructLog[]** - list of `StructLog` objects representing the opcodes executed during the transaction.

##### StructLog

The `StructLog` object represents an individual opcode executed during a smart contract transaction.

It contains the following fields:

- `pc`: **number** - program counter.
- `op`: **string** - opcode.
- `gas`: **number** - gas remaining.
- `gasCost`: **number** - gas cost of the opcode.
- `depth`: **number** - call depth.
