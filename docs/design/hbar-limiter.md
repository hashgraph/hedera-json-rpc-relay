## Purpose

The purpose of the HBar Limiter is to track and control the spending of HBars in real-time across various operations and transaction types. It aims to provide flexible hbar limiting capabilities for relay operators, ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing potential misuse or drainage of HBars.

## Goals

1. Implement real-time tracking of HBar spending across different operations and transaction types.
2. Provide configurable limiting based on various criteria such as sending address and IP address.
3. Offer tiered access control for different user groups or projects.
4. Enable early detection and prevention of potential HBar drainage.
5. Support flexible alerting mechanisms for spending thresholds.

## Requirements

### Spending Tracking

1. Track HBar spending in real-time.
2. Categorize spending by:
   a. Operation type (e.g., FileAppend, FileCreate)
   b. Transaction type (Ethereum or Hedera)

### Spending Limits

1. Compare current spending against:
   a. Total predefined limit
   b. Current operator balance
2. Support limits based on transaction origin address (`tx.from`).
   1. Limit based on `tx.from`
   2. Limit based on IP
3. Support tiered spending limits, e.g.:
   - **Tier 1**: Trusted Partners (unlimited)
   - **Tier 2**: Supported projects (higher limit)
   - **Tier 3**: General users (standard limit)

### Early Detection and Prevention (Preemptive Rate Limit)

**Preemptive Rate Limiting for HFS Transactions**

1. Calculate the number of potential HFS transactions based on the size of the incoming call data:

   - **File Create:** 1 transaction
   - **File Append:** (size_of_call_data / file_chunk_size) transactions

2. Use the [Hedera Fee Estimator](https://hedera.com/fees) to estimate the costs of each HFS transaction, based on the maximum chunk size configuration (currently set to 5 KB).

3. Calculate the total estimated fee and compare it against the remaining budget to determine if a preemptive rate limit should be applied.

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

The HBar limiter will be implemented as a separate service, used by other services/classes that need it. It will have two main purposes - to capture the gas fees for different operation and to check if an operation needs to be paused, due to an exceeded HBar limit.

### What is an HbarSpendingPlan?

An `HbarSpendingPlan` is a record that tracks the total amount of HBars spent by a user or group of users (linked by ETH and IP addresses) over a specific period. It includes the following information:
- **id**: A unique identifier for the spending plan.
- **subscriptionTier**: The tier of the user or group of users (BASIC, EXTENDED, or PRIVILEGED).
- **createdAt**: The timestamp when the spending plan was created.
- **active**: A flag indicating whether the spending plan is currently active.
- **spendingHistory**: A list of spending records, each containing the amount spent and the timestamp.

### Relay Operator (OPERATOR tier):

The relay operator will have a total budget for the HBARs that can be spent in a given time window (this is the total limit for all users). 
The operator will have a separate spending plan, linked to the operator's EVM address, which will track the total amount spent by the operator.
The operator's spending plan will be used to check if the total amount spent exceeds the budget and to pause all spending if necessary.
If at some point, the operator's total spending exceeds the budget, all subsequent requests from any user will be blocked until the next reset.

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|sends transaction| B[JSON-RPC Relay]
    B --> C{Estimate fees to be paid by the relay operator}
    C --> |total budget would get exceeded| I[Limit request]
    C --> |there is enough remaining budget to cover fees| J[Execute transaction]
    J --> K[Capture all fees charged during the execution]
    K --> L[Update the amount spent of the operator's spending plan]
```

### Tiered Spending Limits:

Apart from the total limit which is imposed by the operator's spending plan, there will be separate spending plans for different tiers of users (BASIC, EXTENDED, and PRIVILEGED).

Thus, the HBAR limiter will have the following responsibilities:
- **Create and manage spending plans for different tiers of users.**
- **Link users to their respective spending plans based on their addresses.**
- **On every transaction**:
  - **Check if a user's spending plan has enough balance to cover the fees of a transaction.**
  - **Check if the operator's total spending exceeds the budget.**
  - **If the user's spending plan does not have enough balance or if the operator's total spending exceeds the budget, limit the request.**
  - **Otherwise, execute the transaction and capture all fees charged both into the operator's and the individual user's spending plan.**

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|sends transaction| B[JSON-RPC Relay]
    B --> C[Estimate fees which will be paid by the relay operator]
    C --> D{Retrieve the operator's spending plan}
    D --> |operator has enough remaining budget| F{Proceed with the transaction}
    D --> |operator would exceed the budget| I[Limit the request]
    F -->|new user, i.e., who is not linked to a spending plan| G[Create a new BASIC spending plan]
    G --> H[Link user's ETH & IP addresses to plan]
    F -->|existing user, i.e., who is linked to a spending plan| I2[Retrieve spending plan linked to user]
    I2 --> J{Plan has enough balance to cover fees}
    H --> J
    J --> |no| I[Limit the request]
    J --> |yes| K[Execute transaction]
    K --> L[Capture all fees the operator has been charged during execution]
    L --> M[Update the amount spent of the operator's spending plan and the user's spending plan]
```

### General Users (BASIC tier):

**NOTE:** Each general user will have a unique spending plan, linked both to their ETH and IP addresses. Each new user will be automatically assigned a BASIC spending plan when they send their first transaction and this plan will remain linked to them for any subsequent requests.

### Supported Projects (EXTENDED tier) and Trusted Partners (PRIVILEGED tier):

**NOTE:** There will be one spending plan per project/partner with a total spending limit, shared amongst a group of users (IP and EVM addresses) linked to that plan. This means that they will share a common total spending limit for the project/partner.

All users associated with a project/partner will be pre-configured in the relay as shown in the

### Support flexible alerting mechanisms for spending thresholds
The existing technical infrastructure, prometheus and grafana will be used to trigger alerts.  At the time of this writing 10K HBar is the maximum the relay operator can spend in one day, on HashIO.

The rest of this section describes addtional metrics that will be added, with alerts later, to track critical balances, and how new values for those tiers in HashIO will
be determined.

The initial spending threshold of the Tier 3 General users will be a rough
estimate based on the current daily spending of the Relay Operator.  In order
to refine this over time a prometheus metric called the `basicSpendingPlanCounter`
will be used to track the number of unique spending plans.  

The metrics listed below will be added to help determine the best Tier 3 General users over time:

1. Daily Unique Users Counter
2. Average Daily Users
3. Dynamic Per-User Limit - Daily budget for the Relay Operator (10K) divided by the average number of users
4. Time-based Allocation - Allocating the Relay Operator's budget throughout the day to prevent early users from consuming all resources
5. User History - Track individual user usage over time to identify and manage heavy users
6. Flexible Limits - Implement a system that can adjust limits based on current usage and time of day
   
#### HBar Allocation Strategy
##### Metrics to Track
1. Daily Unique Users
2. Total HBar Spent per Day
3. Rolling Average of Daily Unique Users (e.g., over 7 or 30 days)
4. Individual User Daily and Monthly Usage
   
##### Allocation Algorithm
1. Base Allocation:
   - Daily Budget / Rolling Average of Daily Unique Users = Base User Limit
  
2. Time-Based Adjustment:
   - Divide the day into time slots (e.g., 6 4-hour slots)
   - Allocate a portion of the daily budget to each slot
   - Adjust user limits based on remaining budget in the current slot

3. Dynamic User Limit:
   - Start with the Base User Limit
   - Adjust based on:
a. User's historical usage (lower limit for consistently heavy users)
b. Time of day (higher limits when usage is typically lower)
c. Current day's usage (increase limits if overall usage is low)

4. Flexible Ceiling:
   - Implement a hard cap (e.g., 2x Base User Limit) to prevent single user from consuming too much

5. Reserve Pool:
   - Keep a small portion of the daily budget (e.g., 10%) as a reserve
   - Use this to accommodate unexpected spikes or high-priority users

## Configurations

### Pre-populating the Cache with Spending Plans for Supported Projects and Partner Projects

The following configurations will be used to automatically populate the cache with `HbarSpendingPlan`, `EvmAddressHbarSpendingPlan`, and `IPAddressHbarSpendingPlan` entries for the outlined supported projects and partner projects on every start-up of the relay.

All other users (ETH and IP addresses which are not specified in the configuration file) will be treated as "general users" and will be assigned a basic `HbarSpendingPlan` on their first request and their EVM address and IP address will be linked to that plan for all subsequent requests.

### JSON Configuration File

The relay will read the pre-configured spending plans from a JSON file. This file should be placed in the root directory of the relay.

The default filename for the configuration file is `spendingPlansConfig.json`, but it could also be specified by the environment variable `HBAR_SPENDING_PLANS_CONFIG`.
- `HBAR_SPENDING_PLANS_CONFIG`: The name of the file or environment variable containing the pre-configured spending plans for supported projects and partners.

#### The JSON file should have the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "c758c095-342c-4607-9db5-867d7e90ab9d",
    "name": "partner name",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x123", "0x124"],
    "ipAddresses": ["127.0.0.1", "128.0.0.1"],
    "subscriptionTier": "PRIVILEGED"
  },
  {
    "id": "a68488b0-6f7d-44a0-87c1-774ad64615f2",
    "name": "some other partner that has given us only evm addresses",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x125", "0x126"],
    "subscriptionTier": "PRIVILEGED"
  },
  {
    "id": "af13d6ed-d676-4d33-8b9d-cf05d1ad7134",
    "name": "supported project name",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x127", "0x128"],
    "ipAddresses": ["129.0.0.1", "130.0.0.1"],
    "subscriptionTier": "EXTENDED"
  },
  {
    "id": "7f665aa3-6b73-41d7-bf9b-92d04cdab96b",
    "name": "some other supported project that has given us only ip addresses",
    "ipAddresses": ["131.0.0.1", "132.0.0.1"],
    "subscriptionTier": "EXTENDED"
  }
]
```

#### Important notes
- The `id` field is **strictly required** for each supported project or partner project. It is used as a unique identifier and as key in the cache and also for reference in the logs. We recommend using a UUID for this field, but any unique string will work.
- The `name` field is used just for reference and can be any string. It is not used in the cache or for any other purpose, only for better readability in the logs on start-up of the relay when the spending plans are being configured.
- The `evmAddresses` and `ipAddresses` fields are arrays of strings containing the EVM addresses and IP addresses associated with the supported project or partner project. **At least one** of these two fields must be present and contain **at least one entry**.
- The `subscriptionTier` field is also **required**. It is an enum with the following possible values: `BASIC`, `EXTENDED`, and `PRIVILEGED`.

On every start-up, the relay will check if these entries are already populated in the cache. If not, it will populate them accordingly. 

If the cache already contains some of these entries, it will only populate the new entries and remove the obsolete ones.

### Incremental changes to the JSON file

#### Adding new partners or supported projects

The JSON file can also be updated over time to add new partners or supported projects, and it will populate only the new entries on the next start-up.

```javascript
[
  // rest of JSON file remains the same
  ...oldContent,
  {
    "id": "0b054498-5c48-4402-aad4-b9b455f33457",
    "name": "new partner name",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x129", "0x130"],
    "ipAddresses": ["133.0.0.1"],
    "subscriptionTier": "PRIVILEGED"
  }
]
```

#### Removing or updating existing partners or supported projects

If some of the pre-configured plans are removed them from the JSON file, they will be considered "obsolete" and removed from the cache on the next start-up of the relay.

You can also add new EVM addresses or IP addresses to existing plans by updating the JSON file.

```javascript
[
  // rest of JSON file remains the same
  ...oldContent,
  {
    "id": "c758c095-342c-4607-9db5-867d7e90ab9d",
    "name": "partner name",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x123", "0x124", "<new_evm_address>"],
    "ipAddresses": ["127.0.0.1", "128.0.0.1", "<new_ip_address>", "<another_new_ip_address>"],
    "subscriptionTier": "PRIVILEGED",
  }
]
```

Or if you remove any existing EVM addresses or IP addresses from the JSON file, only those will be removed from the cache on the next start-up.

```javascript
[
  // rest of JSON file remains the same
  ...oldContent,
  {
    "id": "c758c095-342c-4607-9db5-867d7e90ab9d",
    "name": "partner name",
    "evmAddresses": ["0x123"], // removed "0x124"
    "ipAddresses": ["127.0.0.1"], // removed "128.0.0.1"
    "subscriptionTier": "PRIVILEGED",
  }
]
```

### Spending Limits of Different Tiers

**Units:** All environment variables are specified in tinybars (tℏ):
```math
1 HBAR (ℏ) = 100,000,000 tinybars (tℏ)
```

The spending limits for different tiers are defined as environment variables:
- `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_BASIC`: The spending limit (tℏ) for general users (tier 3)
- `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_EXTENDED`: The spending limit (tℏ) for supported projects (tier 2)
- `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_PRIVILEGED`: The spending limit (tℏ) for trusted partners (tier 1)

Example configuration for tiered spending limits:
```dotenv
HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_BASIC=10000000# 0.1 ℏ
HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_EXTENDED=100000000# 1 ℏ
HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_PRIVILEGED=1000000000# 10 ℏ
```

### Total Budget and Limit Duration

The total budget and the limit duration are defined as environment variables:
- `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION`: The time window (in milliseconds) for which both the total budget and the spending limits are applicable. 
  - On initialization of `HbarLimitService`, a reset timestamp is calculated by adding the `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION` to the current timestamp.
  - The total budget and spending limits are reset when the current timestamp exceeds the reset timestamp.
- `HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_TINYBAR`: The ceiling on the total amount (in tℏ) that can be spent in the limit duration. 
  - This is the spending limit (tℏ) for the operator (tier 0).
  - This is the largest bucket from which others pull from.
  - If the operator's spending exceeds this limit, **all spending is paused until the next reset**.

Example configuration for a total budget and limit duration:
```dotenv
HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_TINYBAR=11000000000# 110 ℏ
HBAR_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION=80000# 80 seconds
```

## Additional Considerations

### Performance

1. Ensure minimal impact on transaction processing times. (Capturing of transaction fees should happen asynchronously behind the scenes)
2. Design for high throughput to handle peak transaction volumes

### Monitoring and logging

1. Use the existing logger in the relay
2. Build on existing dashboards for system health and rate limiting statistics. Add any new metrics to the current dashboards.

## Future enhancements

1. Machine learning-based anomaly detection for unusual spending patterns.
