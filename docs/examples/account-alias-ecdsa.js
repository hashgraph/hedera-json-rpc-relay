     * Hedera supports a form of lazy account creation.
     *
     * You can "create" an account by generating a private key, and then deriving the public key,
     * without any need to interact with the Hedera network.  The public key more or less acts as the user's
     * account ID.  This public key is an account's aliasKey: a public key that aliases (or will eventually alias)
     * to a Hedera account.
     *
     * An AccountId take on multiple forms. 2 notable mentions are 1.: a normal AccountId with a null aliasKey member takes the form 0.0.123,
     * while an account ID with a non-null aliasKey member takes the form
     * 0.0.302a300506032b6570032100114e6abc371b82dab5c15ea149f02d34a012087b163516dd70f44acafabf7777
     * Note the prefix of "0.0." indicating the shard and realm.  Also note that the aliasKey is stringified
     * as a hex-encoded ASN1 DER representation of the key.
     *
     * An AccountId with an aliasKey can be used just like a normal AccountId for the purposes of queries and
     * transactions, however most queries and transactions involving such an AccountId won't work until Hbar has
     * been transferred to the aliasKey account.
     *
     * There is no record in the Hedera network of an account associated with a given aliasKey
     * until an amount of Hbar is transferred to the account.  The moment that Hbar is transferred to that aliasKey
     * AccountId is the moment that that account actually begins to exist in the Hedera ledger.
