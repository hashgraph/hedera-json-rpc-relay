##### The JSON RPC relay serves as an interface to the Hedera network for ethereum developer tools that utilize the implemented JSON RPC APIs. The following development tools have been tested and the extent of their coverage is noted below.

### Supported tools

Note:
On contract deployment, most of the tools (e.g. [ethersjs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/address/#utils--contract-addresses)) pre-compute the contract address on the client-side, based
on sender address and nonce. In the Hedera ecosystem, it's not like that, where it's just the next available id.
[ethersjs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and therefore Hardhat usage are impacted by this address calculation difference with the details captured [here](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/3141).
An extra step to retrieve the valid Hedera contract address is required to workaround this challenge, example workarounds are provided below.

#### Option 1
```typescript
// init the contract factory
const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode, wallet);
// deploy the contract
let contract = await factory.deploy();

// wait till the transaction has reached consensus and get the contract address from the receipt
const { contractAddress } = await contract.deployTransaction.wait();

// re-init the contract with the deployed address
contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractJson.abi, wallet);
```

#### Option 2
```typescript
// init the contract factory
const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode, wallet);
// deploy the contract
let contract = await factory.deploy();

// wait for transaction to reach consensus
await contract.deployed();

// get the transaction receipt
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(contract.deployTransaction.hash);

// re-init the contract with the deployed address
contract = new ethers.Contract(receipt.contractAddress, contractJson.abi, wallet);
```
