# Brownie

[Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) is an open-source Python-based framework for testing, deploying, and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. Built on top of the `web3.py` library, Brownie is designed to streamline the development workflow for decentralized applications by providing an easy-to-use interface for tasks such as contract deployment, testing, and debugging. It supports both Solidity and Vyper.

Brownie's main capabilities are:

- **Automated Contract Testing**: Facilitates both unit and integration testing using Python, with the ability to create fixtures, mocks, and use `pytest` for comprehensive test coverage.
- **Local Blockchain Environment**: Integrates with Ganache, allowing for the quick setup of a local Ethereum environment for development, testing, and debugging.
- **Contract Interaction**: Provides an intuitive API for interacting with smart contracts, including sending transactions, calling functions, and retrieving events.
- **Built-in Debugging Tools**: Offers detailed transaction tracing and error reporting to aid in identifying bugs and optimizing gas usage.
- **Seamless Integration with Development Pipelines**: Brownie can be easily integrated into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows to ensure contract reliability.

## Installation:

To install Brownie, the recommended approach is using `pip`:

```Shell
pip install eth-brownie
```

You may also want to start the Hedera Local Node to run a local blockchain for testing:
https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node

Once installed, you can initialize a new project:

```Shell
brownie init
```

Brownie supports both Solidity and Vyper contract languages.

Brownie will automatically download the required Solidity compiler and dependencies when you first compile a contract.

You may also install additional dependencies running:

```Shell
brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.4.0
```

## Tool Analysis:

### Key Features and Advantages:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Brownie supports Ethereum-compatible blockchains, it can be used for Hedera Smart Contracts development.

2. **Contract Testing and Debugging**:
    - Brownie uses `pytest` for its testing framework, providing access to Pythonâ€™s testing ecosystem. You can write both unit tests and functional tests for contracts.
    - Transaction debugging is powerful with detailed stack traces, revert reasons, and gas reports.

3. **Ease of Use**: By leveraging Python, a well-known and widely used programming language, Brownie makes it easier for developers to interact with the blockchain and smart contracts without needing deep knowledge of Solidity or EVM bytecode.

5. **Event Monitoring and Logging**: Contracts deployed via Brownie are easy to monitor through event subscriptions, and the logs can be analyzed to detect specific contract behaviors in real-time.

### Limitations and Considerations:

1. **Dependency on `web3.py`**: As Brownie is built on `web3.py`, it inherits some of the limitations and idiosyncrasies of this library. Regular updates to `web3.py` are necessary to maintain compatibility with the latest Ethereum features.

2. **Complex Projects**: For highly complex or large-scale projects, the simplified Python-based testing environment might require additional customization or integration with other more advanced development tools.

> **Community and Support**:
> Brownie is no longer actively maintained, although developers can engage with the community on the [official GitHub](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) page or the [Python Ethereum Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/YGzGZEfSBc).

## Tests performed

# Using Brownie (https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) with Hedera Hashgraph

- Activate Python virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Install Brownie
```
pip3 install eth-brownie
```
- Create a Brownie project
```
mkdir brownie-test-project
cd brownie-test-project
brownie init
```
- Add an account and start Brownie console
```
brownie networks list
brownie accounts new myaccount
brownie console --network hedera-test
```
- Check that Brownie can fetch balance of the account
```
>>> accounts.load('myaccount')
>>> accounts[0].balance()
```
- Exit Brownie console and create "Token" subproject
```
brownie bake token
cd token
brownie compile
```
- Start the console
```
brownie console --network hedera-test
```
- Check that "Token" is available
```
>>> accounts.load('myaccount')
>>> Token
```
- Deploy a token contract
```
>>> t = Token.deploy("Test Token", "TST", 18, 1e23, {'from': accounts[0]})
```

# Brownie usage example

Simple scripts for basic operations like hbars transfer, balance fetching, and contract interactions (deployment and calls).

## Setup & Install

Follow the instructions from the installation section above.

## Running tests

After installing brownie you can go to your project directory and run following script:

1. Run `brownie test --network hedera-test`

## Deploying your Smart Contract

1. Run `brownie run deploy --network hedera-test`
