# Subgraph example

Simple subgraph indexing the `GreeterSet` event of emitted by the [modified] Greeter contract

For more information on subgraphs, check the official TheGraph documentation https://thegraph.com/docs/en/

## Prerequisites:

### JSON-RPC Relay configurations:

Note: Currently you'll have to start the relay from the main branch in this repo, because it contains important bugfixes. This doc will be updated when a new version containing all the fixes is released.

The graph node is configured to run against a local instance of the json-rpc-relay. Be sure to set the following options in your .env file:
```
ETH_GET_LOGS_BLOCK_RANGE_LIMIT=2000
DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT=2000
```

### Deploy and interact with the Greeter contract using one of the other examples:

1. [hardhat-example](../hardhat-example)
3. [web3js-example](../web3js-example)

Note: The Greeter contract has been updated to emit `GreetingSet` event each time a new greeting is set with `setGreeting`.

### Install the dependencies:

Run `npm install` or `yarn [install]`

### Generate the types:

Run `npm run codegen` or `yarn codegen`

### Start a local graph-node:

Run `npm run graph-local` or `yarn graph-local`

Note: If you run the graph-node against a local Hedera node and see this error in the graph-node console:
```
Trying again after eth_getBlockByNumber(0, false) RPC call failed (attempt #10) with result Err(Ethereum node could not find genesis block), provider: local-rpc-0
```

Uncomment [this](./docker-compose.yml#L24) line and restart the node.

Every time you restart the hedera-node it is recommended to do a clean-up of the graph-node. To do this run `npm run graph-local-clean` or `yarn graph-local-clean`

### Deploy the subgraph to the local graph-node:

Before deploying the subgraph, be sure to update the address (and startBlock) in `subgraph.yaml` to the address of the deployed Greeter contract.

To deploy the subgraph:

1. Run `npm run create-local` or `yarn create-local`
2. Run `npm run deploy-local` or `yarn deploy-local`
3. Follow the instructions
